<article>    Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task,
        but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.
        [1] Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar.
        Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over
        time became available to all citizens
